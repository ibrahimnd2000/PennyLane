# PennyLane

- Cross-platform Python library for programming quantum computers.
- Connects Quantum Computing with powerful machine learning frameworks like NumPy's autograd, JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, making them quantum-aware.
- Manage the execution of quantum computations including the evaluation of circuits and the computation of their gradients.
- Comes with default simulator devices, but is well-integrated with external software and hardware to run quantum circuits-such as IBM's Qiskit, or Google's Cirq, Rigetti's Forest, or Xanadu's Strawberry Fields.
